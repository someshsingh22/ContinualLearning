**Title:** DualNet: Continual Learning, Fast and Slow (NeurIPS 2021), [[openreview]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eQ7Kh-QeWnO), [[pdf]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/86a1fa88adb5c33bd7a68ac2f9f3f96b-Paper.pdf).

**Authors:** [Quang Pham](https://sites.google.com/view/quangpham93), [Chenghao Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/liuchenghao/home), and [Steven Hoi](https://sites.google.com/view/stevenhoi/home)

DualNet proposes a novel continual learning framework for (online) continual learning where a slow network gradually accumulates knowledge to improves its general representation over time and a fast network utilizes the slow representation to quickly learn new information.
